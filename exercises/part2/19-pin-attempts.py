"""
Programming exercise:
PIN and number of attempts

Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is 4321. The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.

Sample output

PIN: 3245
Wrong
PIN: 1234
Wrong
PIN: 0000
Wrong
PIN: 4321
Correct! It took you 4 attempts

If the user gets it right on the first try, the program should print out something a bit different:

Sample output

PIN: 4321
Correct! It only took you one single attempt!
"""

attempts = 1

while True:
    code = input("PIN: ")

    if code == "4321":
        break

    print("Wrong")
    attempts += 1

if attempts == 1:
    print("Correct! It only took you one single attempt!")
else:
    print(f"Correct! It took you {attempts} attempts")
